# Recipe Data Visualization Analysis

The visualizations explore a large dataset of recipes from Food.com, revealing several interesting patterns. The time-series plot shows how recipe submissions have grown over the years, indicating increasing platform engagement. The recipe complexity visualization (steps vs. ingredients) demonstrates that most recipes use between 5-15 ingredients and 5-20 steps, with a positive correlation between the two. The nutrition distribution reveals wide variations in nutritional content, particularly in calories and sodium levels. The violin plot of preparation time by ingredient count shows that recipes with more ingredients generally take longer to prepare, but with significant variation. Finally, the top tags visualization helps identify the most popular recipe categories, giving insight into common cooking trends and preferences.
