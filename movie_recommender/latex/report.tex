\section{Project Introduction and Planning}

\subsection{Project Overview}
This project implements a movie recommendation system that leverages deep learning techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions to users. The system employs a neural collaborative filtering approach, which learns latent representations of both users and movies through a neural network architecture. The model is trained on the MovieLens dataset and uses embedding layers to capture complex user-movie interactions.
The system addresses the cold-start problem by collecting initial ratings from new users to establish their preference profile. These ratings are then used to generate personalized recommendations through the trained neural network model. The architecture includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User and movie embedding layers that learn latent feature representations
    \item A deep neural network with multiple fully connected layers
    \item Batch normalization and dropout layers for improved training stability
    \item A sigmoid activation function scaled to the rating range
\end{itemize}
The model is trained on the MovieLens dataset, which provides a robust foundation of user-movie interactions. The system is designed to continuously adapt to user preferences as they provide more ratings, improving the accuracy of recommendations over time.
\subsection{Project Objectives}
The primary objectives of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop an effective neural collaborative filtering system for movie recommendations
    \item Implement a solution to the cold-start problem through initial user ratings
    \item Create a user-friendly web interface for rating movies and receiving recommendations
    \item Train and optimize the neural network model on the MovieLens dataset
    \item Ensure scalability and real-time recommendation capabilities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Analysis and Patterns}
An in-depth analysis of the MovieLens dataset revealed several interesting patterns and characteristics that influenced our recommendation system design:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Genre Distribution}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Drama dominates the dataset with 4,361 movies, followed by Comedy (3,756)
        \item Strong presence of Thriller (1,894) and Action (1,828) genres
        \item Less representation of niche genres like Film-Noir and Documentary
        \item Multi-genre movies are common, suggesting complex movie characteristics
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Temporal Distribution}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Dataset spans from 1902 to 2018, providing historical context
        \item Significant increase in movie entries from the 1980s onward
        \item Peak in movie releases around 2015 with approximately 300 movies
        \item Recent years show consistent high volume of releases
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{External References}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Near-perfect IMDB coverage (100\% of movies linked)
        \item Excellent TMDB integration (99.92\% coverage)
        \item Only 8 movies (0.08\%) lacking TMDB references
        \item Strong foundation for fetching additional movie metadata
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{User Tagging Behavior}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 3,683 total tags applied across 1,572 unique movies
        \item Active user base with 58 unique contributors
        \item Average of 2.34 tags per movie
        \item Most tagged movie has 181 tags, showing high user engagement
        \item Popular tags include "In Netflix queue" (131 occurrences) and "atmospheric" (36 occurrences)
